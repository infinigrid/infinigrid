# Building

The recommended way to use Infinigrid is to fork https://github.com/infinigrid/infinigrid
and build your application from there.

## Build the examples

```
$ npm run build:example
```

You will find the compiled examples in `./build/`.

Edit one of the examples or create a new file in `./example/` to get started.

Tip: Use `npm run build:example -- -w` to recompile automatically.
